I've tried Kurver Kreme in Colonie, Tastee Freeze in Delmar and Country Drive Inn in Clifton Park, but I think that this place has the best soft serve ice cream.  The portions are generous and the taste is very rich.  For example, the brownie sundae is decadently delicious but likely too much for one person.  They also have cupcake sundaes which I am looking to try soon!\\n\",\n",
